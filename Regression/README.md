# DeepLearning
Some experiments I made in Deep Learning


Here is my first experiment implementing some very easy functions (Addition, Sum, Multiplication) in Keras. 

The idea is to play with some toy problems in order to understand how works regression in  Neural Networks before to start with real problems. 

The weights of the models are saved in .h5 files, the model itself in .jason files.
