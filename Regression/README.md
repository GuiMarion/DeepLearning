Some experiments I made in Deep Learning


Here is my first experiment implementing some very easy functions (Addition, Succesor, Sum, Multiplication) in Keras. 

The idea is to play with some toy problems in order to understand how works regression in  Neural Networks before to start with real problems. 

The weights of the models are saved in .h5 files, the model itself in .jason files. 
If you want to train again the models, please remove the .h5 file corresponding, if it already exist weights for your model the program will load them and predict a solution for a random input. 

The initialization may have a very big influence on training, so sometimes when you find that the loss is stuck during the training, just kill it and relaunch the program to start with another initialization.
